  Sync Claude Code sessions and config between machines over SSH — enumerate
  recent sessions across a workspace and its subdirectory project slots, let
  the user pick, copy transcripts with side directories, verify integrity,
  audit repo/secret/toolchain dependencies on the target, merge memory
  indexes, and optionally sync commands/skills/config. Supports a default
  peer (~/.claude/cc-sync.conf) and a silent SessionEnd auto-sync hook.
  Use when the user wants to: (1) continue sessions on another machine
  (laptop/desktop/server), (2) list recently active sessions for a workspace,
  (3) sync session-generated artifacts and gitignored secrets to a second
  machine, (4) merge memory directories after working on two machines,
  (5) copy commands/skills/settings to another machine.
  Triggers on: "cc-sync", "migrate session", "sync sessions", "会话迁移",
  "迁移会话", "同步会话", "同步配置", "把会话搬到", "换电脑继续",

# cc-sync

The skill directory (SKILL_DIR) is at `~/.claude/skills/cc-sync`.
If that path doesn't exist, fall back to Glob with pattern
`**/skills/**/cc-sync/SKILL.md` and derive the root from the result.

## Task

Move Claude Code sessions from this machine to another so work continues
seamlessly there. Four phases — each can be skipped independently if the user
only needs part of the flow. You orchestrate and exercise judgment; the bundled
scripts do only the mechanical parts. The user always picks which sessions to
move — never pick for them.

If the user names no target machine, read `~/.claude/cc-sync.conf` — its
`DEFAULT_PEER=user@host` line is the configured peer. No conf and no target →
ask.

## How sessions are stored

Details and observed record formats: `references/internals.md` (read when needed).

- Slot name = project **absolute path** with every non-alphanumeric character
  replaced by `-`, under `~/.claude/projects/`. Subdirectory projects
  (`<ws>/crm`, `<ws>/backend`, …) each get their own slot.
- A session = `<uuid>.jsonl` transcript + an **optional side directory of the
  same uuid** (subagents / tool-results / workflows). They must travel together.
- Display name lives inside the transcript as the last `aiTitle` record;
  older sessions may only have `summary` records.
- A slot may contain a `memory/` directory (auto-memory: `MEMORY.md` index +
  one file per memory).
- Resuming on the target requires the **same absolute project path**, then
  `cd <project-path> && claude --resume`.

## Phase 0 — Preflight

Use these SSH options everywhere:
`-o BatchMode=yes -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new -o ConnectTimeout=5`.

1. Connectivity: `ssh $SSH_OPTS user@host 'echo ok; echo $HOME'`. If it times
   out and the machines may be on different networks, try the target's
   **Tailscale hostname** instead of a LAN IP (`tailscale status` lists online
   devices). Direct mode needs both ends online — a sleeping Mac at home is
   unreachable; suggest "Wake for network access" + keep it plugged in.
2. Path parity: remote `$HOME` and the project path must equal the local ones.
   If they differ, **stop and tell the user** — resumed sessions won't be found
   under a different path (address rewriting is out of scope).
3. Locate the remote `claude` CLI. Non-interactive SSH has a thin PATH; check
   `~/.local/bin/claude`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude`, `~/.claude/local/claude`.
   Compare `claude --version` on both ends (mismatched major versions are worth
   flagging, minor drift is fine).
4. Reuse of results: `list-sessions.sh --remote` (below) shows what already
   exists on the target without deploying anything.

## Phase 1 — List, pick, sync

1. **List** local sessions for the workspace and all its subdirectory slots:

   ```bash
   bash "SKILL_DIR/scripts/list-sessions.sh" <project-path> [days=20]
   ```

   TSV out: `mtime, slot-suffix, title, size, session-id, sidedir`. Render it
   as a table (time / project / title / size / short id), mark the current
   session — it is still being written, so it gets a final re-sync in Phase 4.

2. **Pick**: present the table and wait for the user's selection (by title, id
   prefix, or "all"). This is a judgment call that is never yours to make.

3. **Sync** each chosen session:

   ```bash
   bash "SKILL_DIR/scripts/sync-session.sh" <project-path> <session-id> user@host
   ```

   Copies transcript + side directory, then verifies (sha256 + file counts).
   Prints `IN_SYNC <id>` when both sides already match (nothing copied).
   Two refusal modes, neither to be overridden without the user's explicit
   confirmation:

   - Exit 3 = `DIVERGED`: the remote copy is **larger**, meaning the session
     was already resumed on the target.
   - Exit 4 = `DIVERGED_SAME_SIZE`: **same size but different content** — the
     two copies have genuinely diverged (e.g. one was forked, which rewrites
     large records into many small ones and can leave the byte count
     identical). Size cannot see this, so content is compared by hash.

   Report either to the user and stop.

4. **Report**: verified list + a resume table grouped by slot, e.g.
   `cd ~/WorkSpace/vigolive/crm && claude --resume` for crm-slot sessions.

## Phase 2 — Dependency audit

Sessions reference things that don't travel with the transcript. For each
synced session, extract its footprint:

```bash
bash "SKILL_DIR/scripts/audit-deps.sh" <project-path> <session-id>
```

Output: `CWD <count> <path>` (working dirs), `WRITE` / `PLAN` / `MEMORY`
(files written). Then classify and act — this part is judgment, not script:

- **Git repos** (from CWD paths): on both ends compare `git log -1`, current
  branch, dirty and untracked files, and remote URLs. Committed+pushed work
  travels via `git pull`, not file copy. Uncommitted environment-switch edits
  (API host in an xcconfig, a disabled scheduler annotation) are often *needed*
  on the target — show the diff, ask, then `scp` the file.
- **Secrets**: read the repo's build/release scripts and work backwards to the
  gitignored inputs they read (`git status --ignored` helps): root-level key
  files, `local.properties`, keystores, plus home-level keys such as
  `~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/`. Copy only what's missing on the target.
  If a secret exists on both ends but differs, show size/mtime/hash of each
  side and ask — **never silently overwrite**. Never print secret contents
  into the conversation; report names, sizes, and hashes only.
- **Non-git artifact dirs** (analysis outputs, scratch dirs the session wrote
  into): `rsync -a <dir> user@host:<parent>/` wholesale.
- **PLAN files**: copy to remote `~/.claude/plans/` (mkdir -p first).
- **Toolchain**: for every tool the release/build scripts invoke (xcodebuild,
  xcodegen, SDK dirs, java, …), check existence on the target and report gaps.

## Phase 3 — Memory merge

For each slot that has `memory/` locally, check the remote side:

- Remote slot has no `memory/`: copy wholesale — `rsync -a memory user@host:<slot>/`.
- Both sides have one: individual memory files rarely collide (different eras
  use different names) — `rsync -a --exclude MEMORY.md memory user@host:<slot>/`,
  then merge `MEMORY.md` by hand: read both, back up the remote as
  `MEMORY.md.pre-merge-<YYYYMMDD>`, write a merged index with the local
  (newer) entries first and remote-only entries preserved under an
  `## Earlier memories` section. **Never drop an entry.** If an individual
  file does collide, keep the newer one and say so.

## Config sync (on request)

When the user also wants their Claude Code *setup* on the other machine (not
just sessions), sync these — judgment applies to each:

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/commands/`, `~/.claude/skills/` — usually
  safe to `rsync -a` wholesale. **Resolve symlinks first** (`rsync -aL` or
  copy the link target): skills/commands are often symlinked into a dotfiles
  or brain repo, and a dangling link on the target is worse than a copy.
- `~/.claude/settings.json` — machine-specific (paths, sounds, hooks that
  reference local files). Never overwrite blindly: diff both sides, show the
  user, merge only the keys they want.
- Credentials/keychain never travel — the target machine's own `claude` login
  is used. Do not copy `.credentials.json`.

## Auto-sync (optional, installed by install.sh)

If the user opted in, a `SessionEnd` hook runs `scripts/auto-sync.sh`: every
time a session ends, its transcript + side directory are pushed to
`DEFAULT_PEER`, silently. It uses the same divergence guard — it skips when
the peer copy is larger **or** when the sizes match but the hashes differ —
and exits quietly on any failure; an offline peer never blocks or noises up
a session. A skipped/failed auto-sync is healed by the next one, or by running
Phase 1 manually. To set it up later:
re-run `install.sh` (or `CC_SYNC_PEER=user@host bash install.sh`).

## Phase 4 — Final sync & discipline

The session driving this migration keeps growing after every sync. Before the
user leaves, re-run `sync-session.sh` for it and hand them the exact command
so they can fire it last-minute themselves.

Rules to state in the final report:

- **One machine per session.** Transcripts are append-only; two machines
  appending to the same session produce histories that cannot be merged.
  A synced session's home is now the target.
- If a session did fork, the guard refuses in **both** directions rather than
  guessing: a larger end means it was resumed there (exit 3), and an equal
  size with a different hash means the two histories genuinely diverged
  (exit 4). Ask the user which side to keep, then re-run with `--force` in the
  chosen direction — the skill is symmetric, just run it on the other machine.
- Cross-network: with Tailscale on both ends, the flow is identical to LAN —
  only the hostname changes.

## Implementation pitfalls (do not "optimize" these away)

- Slot dirs start with `-`; `find` needs the `./` prefix or it parses them as flags.
- zsh does not word-split unquoted variables; the scripts are bash and loop
  with `while IFS= read -r` — keep it that way.
- Title extraction degrades `aiTitle` → `summary` → `(untitled)`; these are
  undocumented internals and may change across Claude Code versions.
- Divergence check runs *before* copying and compares size **and content
  hash**. Append-only semantics make size a reliable "resumed on the target"
  signal, but size alone is blind to a fork that rewrote records at constant
  byte count — hence the hash. Do not "simplify" this back to size-only.

## Bundled Resources

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/list-sessions.sh` | Enumerate sessions for a project + subdirectory slots → TSV. `--remote user@host` runs it on the target via `ssh bash -s` (zero deployment). |
| `scripts/sync-session.sh` | Copy one session (transcript + side dir) with size **and hash** divergence guard and sha256/count verification. Exit 0/1/2/3/4. |
| `scripts/audit-deps.sh` | Extract a session's footprint (CWD distribution, files written) as classified TSV. Local only. |
| `scripts/auto-sync.sh` | SessionEnd hook target: silent, divergence-guarded push of the just-ended session to DEFAULT_PEER. |
| `uninstall.sh` | Remove skill + auto-sync hook + conf; synced data is never touched. |
| `references/internals.md` | Observed storage format notes (slot naming, record types, versions). Read when debugging extraction or after a Claude Code upgrade changes behavior. |
